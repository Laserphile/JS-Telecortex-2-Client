## OSX setup
There are many ways to scream in frustration about opencv4nodejs. But this is my favorite way.

Make sure your Node version is shit. My favorite outdated version is `v11.15.0`. Anything newer and you are in the *_\*DANGER ZONE\*_*.

Make sure opencv is *not* installed. Seriously, I spent days on this and only a pristine slate worked for me.
- `brew uninstall opencv opencv@2 opencv@3`
- `brew uninstall ffmpeg tesseract`

Install yarn `brew install yarn`

Now you can run `yarn`. It will hide the build output, but be patient and it should work.
IF you are stuck on this for ages its a good thing:
```
[1/4] üîç  Resolving packages...
[2/4] üöö  Fetching packages...
[3/4] üîó  Linking dependencies...
[4/4] üî®  Building fresh packages...
[1/10] ‚†Ñ opencv-build
[-/10] ‚†Ñ waiting...
[-/10] ‚†Ñ waiting...
[-/10] ‚°Ä waiting...

```
### You lied and it still fails to build
Try this: ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
```bash
yarn --ignore-scripts
./download-binary.sh
```

### Balena dev setup
If you want to push to your pi without going through the pipeline. Make sure you also "enable local mode" on BalenaCloud if its a cloud image.
- `npm install --global --production --unsafe-perm balena-cli`
- `sudo balena local scan`
Get the ip address of the device you want to push to from the output.
- `sudo balena push 192.168.1.120` or whatever the IP is.
